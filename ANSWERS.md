1. What are PropTypes used for? Please describe why it's important to type check our data in JavaScript.

   PropTypes are used to check that the value _type_ of each prop (string, number, etc.) is the one the function receiving the prop is expecting. PropTypes provide an extra layer of debugging, since, for example, the number 78 and the string "78" look the same (to a human) in many instances, but obviously behave differently in JavaScript. PropTypes can also tag a prop as required, and will thus throw an error if a required prop is undefined. The errors that PropTypes throws appear in the browser console, not in the terminal or IDE. This makes it clear that PropTypes error messages are not redundant to an IDE or compiler error message (at least not the ones I'm using).
